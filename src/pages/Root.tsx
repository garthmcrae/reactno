            If you need to build a lightweight and performant web application or
            web site and you are familiar with React this approach may be a
            viable solution for you. React No, **** **.

                React No is a work in progress and open to feedback. Please
                checkout Github for the code and star if you like the idea. This
                repository currently has {stars} stars. Thanks.

            For build we are using Vite the "next generation frontend tooling".
            It consists of a development server and "a build command that
            bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly
            optimized static assets for production".
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Rollup is also "the JavaScript module bundler". If I was to publish
            any of the files from this project to NPM I would use Rollup to
            bundle the module.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph last>
            Something I found really neat was Vite allows you to easily import
            raw files as a string so adding code examples to this project was a
            cinch, that being said when reviewing the bundle and testing I did
            observe that the string literals for the code aren't minified (which
            makes sense) and also render slowly.

            React? No â€” this is a Preact project not a React project. Preact is
            a "fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API". For an
            additional ~2kB you can include a React compatibility layer which
            means at surface level components look identical and can be copied
            and used in either React or Preact projects.

            Last but not least this project also uses TypeScript.
